Q1) Write a query to filter data from cassandra table or how to use where clause
    # Rules for where clause - It can be used effectively with high performance for given below type of columns
    # 1.) Partition Key (Single or Composite)
                       #OR
    # 2.) if Cluster column  used in where clause then it should be with Partition Key
                       #OR
    # 3.) A column on which we have applied the index
                       #OR
    # 4.) A column which is not part of partition key or index column or clustering column then we can use where clause but we have to
    # use keyword ALLOW FILTERING - it will be a super slow performance when data volume is very high

Q2) Group by in cassandra  -  Allowed for all columns which are part of Primary Key
    # Follow given below rules
    # Rule - 1 : Use only partition key in the group by
                  #OR
    # Rule - 2 : if Cluster key column is used then follow the actual declared sequence in the primary key
