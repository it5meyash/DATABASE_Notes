CAP theoram -  It states that it is impossible for a distributed data system to simultaneously provide consistency (C), availability (A), and partition tolerance (P) under certain failure scenarios.
               Consistency refers to all nodes in a distributed system having the same view of data at the same time. 
               Availability means that the system continues to operate and respond to client requests even in the presence of failures. 
               Partition tolerance refers to the system's ability to function and maintain data consistency despite network partitions.
